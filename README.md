# Decision Trees in Machine Learning

## Overview
Decision trees are powerful and intuitive tools in machine learning that are used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively splitting data based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

This repository explores various aspects of decision trees, including algorithms like:
- **J48** (an extension of C4.5)
- **M5P** (a model tree that combines decision trees with linear regression)
